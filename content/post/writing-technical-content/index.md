## Third-Year Undergraduate Course


### Paper B18: Biomedical Modelling and Monitoring (2023-present)
Cellular Physiology, Systems Physiology, Wearable Technology, Medical Imaging

### Paper B14: Information Engineering Systems (2022-2023)
Image Processing, Signal Analysis, Estimation, Inference

Information Engineering Laboratory (2022-present)

In this laboratory the students will learn to implement some of the techniques presented during the lectures in MATLAB. The topics covered are: Basic image manipulation, image filtering in the spatial (convolution) and frequency domains (FFT), image denoising and deblurring, how to generate random samples from a distribution, manipulate Normal distributions and apply statistical inference to infer their parameters, how to combine information from different sensors to obtain more accurate estimations (sensor fusion), compute panoramic mosaics using planar homographies, train a classifier to learn facial expressions. 

Learning Outcomes:
1. Understand how to implement Weiner filters and FFT's and use them for image
denoising
2. Understand how to combine iid multivariate normal measurements
3. Understand how to implement feature extraction and classification
4. Understand how to fuse multi-view imagery
