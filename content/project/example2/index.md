title: Cardiac Motion Analysis
summary: The motion patterns of healthy and unhealthy hearts differ significantly over time. Unhealthy hearts have a motion similar to a balloon losing its elasticity. By recognising these spatio-temporal patterns in heart movement, doctors can identify unhealthy patterns and provide more effective treatment for patients.
