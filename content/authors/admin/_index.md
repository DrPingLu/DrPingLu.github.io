During my academic journey, my passion for machine learning and healthcare has enabled me to forge a pioneering path at the intersection of medical imaging and biomedical signal analysis. I studied Computer Science for both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees. During my Master's studies at the Centre for Image Analysis in Uppsala my interest in medical image analysis grew significantly. My commitment to "machine learning that matters" was evident in my PhD thesis, in which I applied advanced techniques to enhance cochlear implantation through image-guided planning for the human facial nerve.
